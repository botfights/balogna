Liar's Dice
===========

This is a game to pit [Liar's Dice][1] robots against each other.

Liar's Dice is played amongst two or more players, each of whom
begin with a dice cup and five six-sided dice. All players roll their
dice, but don't reveal them. In turn, each player makes a declaration,
such as "two threes" or "three sixes", or, a player may call "Liar".
Each successive call must be higher than the previous (either a higher
quantity, or a higher face with the same quantity). These declarations
are for the *entire* set of dice combined. When a player calls "Liar",
all dice are revealed. If the declartion is met (that is, the number 
of faces is greater than or equal to the quantity claimed), then the 
player who called liar must remove a die from their cup. If not, the 
last player to make the declaration must remove a die from their cup. 
If a player has no more dice in their cup they are out of the game. 
Play continues in this fashion until only one player, the winner,
remains.

In this variation there are no wild dice, and no re-casting of dice.

You can write a robot by implementing the get\_play() function in 
p\_robot/player.py:

    def get_play(me,hands,history) 

        me is the id of your player. eg, "A"

        hands is a serialization of each players hands, all 
        but your own will be masked until the hand is over
        e.g.:
            
            A:23135,B:xx,C:xxxx

        Here, you rolled one one, one two, two threes,
        and a five. There are two other players still in the
        hand, B and C, and they have two and four dice left,
        respectfully.

        history is the history of plays. e.g.:

            A:23,B:33,C:0

        This means, player "A" called "two threes",
        player "B" called "three threes", player C 
        called "liar".

        Your function should return an integer 
        encoding the call, like, 23 for two threes,
        105 for 10 fives, or 0 for "liar".

Your get\_play() function will be called when it is your turn,
and at the end of the hand (in which case the most recent play
will be a call) so you can observe the showdown.

For a quick start to play against the computer:

    $ git clone https://github.com/botfights/liarsdice.git
    $ cd liarsdice
    $ python main.py play p_human p_computer

Next, edit p\_robot/player.py, implement get\_play(), then play your
robot against the computer 100 times:

    $ python main.py tournament 100 p_robot p_computer

Have fun!
